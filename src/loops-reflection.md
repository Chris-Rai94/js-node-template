## Most Challenging Part of Loops

There was a small difference in loops with JavaScript and my other languages.  
The difference being using a semi-colon ; rather than a comma ,.  
This difference was messing with me a lot when I was writing the loops and then would go to  
test it. I would be sitting there wondering what was wrong.  
It would tell me that a semi-colon was needed. I just didn't know where until I asked copilot.

## Not Immediately Apparent

I would say the `.toFixed`
